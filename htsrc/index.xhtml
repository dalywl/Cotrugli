    <h1>Cotrugli, a double entry accounting application</h1>
    <p>
      Benedetto Cotrugli was Dubrovnik merchant, economist, scientist,
      diplomat and humanist and perhaps the first author of a book on
      double entry bookkeeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cotrugli is an experimental accounting application written in
      GNU-APL that uses PostgreSQL to manage its database.
    </p>
    

    <p>
      At this writing, Seventh Month 2021, it will create a trial
      balance and allow one to adjust that that trial balance using an
      application program interface (API). Users well versed in
      GNU-APL can enter and adjust that trial balance by using the
      API. 
    </p>
    
    <p>There is much work to be done and I am looking for volunteers.</p>
