COTRUGLI
========

Today Cotrugli is an application program intgerface to a general
ledger written in APL (https://www.gnu.org/software/apl/).

Cotrugli uses postgresql to store its data and uses APL Library
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/apl-library/).

Tommorrow Cotrugli will become a full fledge accounting software.  You
are invited to join the development effort.

Our plan is:

 1. Develop journals to specific transaction cycles.  We're working on
    a check book journal
 2. Develop Financial Statements prepared from the general ledger.
 3. Develop a graphical user interface.
