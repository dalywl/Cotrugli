COTRUGLI
========

Today Cotrugli is an application program interface to a general
ledger written in APL (https://www.gnu.org/software/apl/).

Cotrugli uses PostgreSQL to store its data and uses APL Library
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/apl-library/).

Tomorrow Cotrugli will become a full fledged accounting software.  You
are invited to join the development effort.

Our plan is:

 1. Develop journals to specific transaction cycles.  We're working on
    a check book journal
 2. Develop Financial Statements prepared from the general ledger.
 3. Develop a graphical user interface.

Be sure to read the documentation files (directory doc).  GL_API.muse
describes the application program interface and setup.muse has
directions on how to setup the database and to start entering
transactions.
